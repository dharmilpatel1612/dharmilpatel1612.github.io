              <p>
                Making little changes in lifestyle can help you maintain good eye health and reduce your risk of
                aging-related eye diseases such age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts.
                Follow this steps for healthy eyes to preserve your vision at its best:
              </p>

              <hr />
              <h4>1. Eat well for healthy vision</h4>
              <p>
                You can lower your chance of acquiring common eye diseases by eating a healthy, balanced diet.
                Eye-friendly nutrients can help prevent age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
                These nutrients can be found in many fruits and vegetables, including spinach, red peppers, kale, leeks,
                avocado, peaches, and blueberries.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cold water fish like sardines, mackerel, and tuna are all top-notch suppliers of DHA and Omega-3 fatty
                acids,
                which give the eye's cell membranes structural support and are advised for dry eye, macular degeneration
                treatment,
                and overall sight preservation.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to recent studies, eating fish just once a week will cut your risk of developing early AMD by
                as much as 40%.
              </p>


              <hr />
              <h4>2. Exercise regularly</h4>
              <p>
                The eyes need oxygen to stay healthy and comfortable. Growing scientific evidence suggests that aerobic
                exercise can
                increase crucial oxygen supplies to the optic nerve and lower pressure in the eye.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reducing intraocular ‘eye’ pressure can help control conditions such as glaucoma and ocular
                hypertension.
                Aerobic exercise can also prevent the progression of diabetes, which in severe cases can lead to
                diabetic retinopathy.
              </p>
              <p>
                To gain any health benefit from exercise the Department of Health recommends doing 30 minutes exercise
                five days a week.
                Brisk walks, cycling and swimming are all excellent ways to reduce intraocular pressure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember to consult your GP before commencing any new exercise programme.
              </p>

              <hr />
              <h4>3. Get a restful night's sleep</h4>
              <p>
                Your eyes can stay bright and rested if you get a decent night's sleep. Your eyes may become sore,
                itchy, swollen, red, and bloodshot due to lack of sleep and exhaustion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Applying a cold compress to your eyes for ten minutes will quickly relieve any discomfort brought on by
                lack of sleep.
                Examples of such compresses include wet tea bags, cucumber slices, or cold wet facecloths.
              </p>

              <hr />
              <h4>4. Quit smoking</h4>
              <p>
                Smokers have a significantly higher risk of eye disease than non-smokers.
                According to research published by the RNIB smokers are twice as likely to loose their sight in later
                life than non-smokers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tobacco chemicals damage the blood vessels behind your eyes and increase your risk of developing
                age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the good news is that if you quit smoking your risk of developing AMD begins to decline.
              </p>
              <p>
                Smoking is also associated with other eye diseases including cataracts.
              </p>

              <hr />
              <h4>5. Protect your eyes by wearing goggles</h4>
              <p>
                According to the British Safety Council, nearly a quarter of a million of us will injure our eyes this
                year,
                with nearly half of these injuries occurring in the home.
              </p>
              <p>
                And, believe it or not, the most common skiing injury is to the eyes, not the legs or arms!
                The danger is not flailing ski sticks, but high levels of ultra-violet (UV) light that can enter and
                burn
                your eyes even on cloudy days. UV levels are highest when the atmosphere is clear, as on the ski slopes,
                and the problem is exacerbated by snow, which reflects light.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you're in a situation where your eyes are at risk, wearing goggles can help prevent injury and keep
                your eyes healthy.
              </p>

              <h4>6. Limit the amount of alcohol that you drink</h4>
              <p>
                Drinking too much alcohol interferes with your liver functions reducing the levels of glutathione
                an efficient antioxidant that can help protect against common eye disease.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Department of Health advises that men should not drink more than three to four units of alcohol per
                day,
                and women should drink no more than two to three units of alcohol per day.
              </p>

              <hr />
              <h4>7. Protect your eyes against the damaging affects of UV light</h4>
              <p>
                Excessive exposure to the sun’s UV rays can lead to a sunburn-like condition called photokeratitis.
                This can be extremely painful and make your eyes red, swollen and watery. T
                he symptoms of photokeratitis – an inflammation of the outer layer of the cornea,
                typically occur after 6 – 12 hours exposure and will normally clear up quickly causing no permanent
                damage to the eye.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the damaging effects of ultraviolet (UV) are cumulative and over a long period your risk of
                developing
                cataracts and other age-related conditions increases significantly.
              </p>
              <p>
                By the age of 18 more than half-a-lifetime’s worth of UV light will have been absorbed by a child’s eyes
                so it’s never too early to start protecting your eyes.
              </p>

              <hr />
              <h4>8. Have regular eye examinations</h4>
              <p>
                Unless otherwise advised by your optometrist, it is recommended that you have an eye examination every
                two years.
                An eye exam will not only detect vision problems, but it will also reveal a number of other underlying
                health issues.
                An eye examination is a necessary health check that helps to keep you and your eyes healthy.
