              <p>
                If you’re concerned that you may be spending too much time on your smartphone, you’re not alone.
              </p>
              <p>
                For many people, cellphone use is an essential part of modern life. We often don’t think twice about
                using our phones for everything from work to communicating with loved ones to mindless scrolling.
              </p>
              <p>
                There’s no formal definition of excessive phone use. If you’re concerned that your phone use is
                impacting your work or relationships, there are steps you can take to manage time on your phone.
              </p>

              <h4>1. Set boundaries with the assistance of your phone.</h4>
              <p>
                If you're concerned about how much time you spend on your phone, it's a good idea to set limits.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most smartphones have built-in features that allow you to track and limit your usage.
                This option is available on Apple under Screen Time and on Android under Digital Wellbeing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some people may discover that they spend more time on specific apps than on their smartphones as a
                whole.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, you might find yourself checking social media apps or playing a specific game for hours on
                end.
                You can use your phone's settings to set timers for individual apps, and you'll receive an alert if you
                go over your daily limit.
              </p>

              <h4>2. Determine your triggers.</h4>
              <p>
                Cellphone misuse is almost always for a reason. Researchers identified several factors that may
                contribute to cellphone overuse, including:
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                desire for social interaction.
              </p>
              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                highlighting engaging features of phones, like enticing audio, images, and tactile elements.
              </p>
              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                avoidance of discomfort, such as looking at your phone to avoid an uncomfortable circumstance.
              </p>
              <p>Finding your triggers and any underlying concerns that may be causing your excessive cellphone use may
                be helpful.</p>

              <h4>3. At night, put your phone away.</h4>
              <p>
                It has been demonstrated that problematic smartphone use before bedtime has a negative impact on the
                quality of sleep.
              </p>
              <p>
                You might try leaving your phone charging overnight in a different room rather than on your nightstand.
                Placing your phone out of reach may also be helpful if you want to use a meditation app or an audiobook
                to fall asleep.
              </p>

              <h4>4. Reduce your notifications.</h4>
              <p>
                There's nothing like the sound of an incoming notification to draw you back to your phone when trying to
                control an addictive behaviour.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may not realise how many alerts you receive throughout the day until you sit down and take stock.
              </p>
              <p>
                Use your phone's Do Not Disturb feature during specific hours, or disable notifications for all but your
                most-used apps.
                This can be an effective way of reminding yourself that you control your phone, not the other way
                around.
              </p>

              <h4>5. Try cognitive behavioural therapy or mindfulness meditation.</h4>
              <p>
                The foundation of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the notion that our ideas affect our feelings
                and behaviours,
                and that by addressing these thoughts, you may alter how you feel and behave.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your underlying thoughts or beliefs that may be motivating your excessive cellphone use can be found by
                working with a CBT therapist.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is little evidence on the most effective ways to treat smartphone addiction because it is not a
                clinically recognised disorder.
                However, some studies indicates that mindfulness-based CBT may be helpful.
              </p>
              <p>
                CBT that is mindfulness-based can assist you in gaining some perspective on your thoughts and urges so
                that you can resist acting on them right away.
              </p>
