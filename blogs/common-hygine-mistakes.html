              <h4>1. Are you the one who instinctively picks up a toothpick after a meal?</h4>

              Put it down right away. While toothpicks may be handy and convenient, they are not the wise choice when
              trying to get food out of your teeth. Dentists confirm that regular tooth picking can lead to
              increased spaces in between the teeth, bleeding of the gums, oral infections and in some cases,
              it can break off and get lodged in the gum tissue causing serious trouble. Of course, we don’t want
              the food to stay stuck inside our mouths. But don’t underestimate the power of water. Every
              time you finish a meal, don’t forget to fill your mouth with water and properly swish it inside and
              spit out for 1-2 times. You will be amazed to see how small particles of food which otherwise
              could have caused cavities will be pushed out.
              </p>

              <h4>2. Not changing your Pillow covers often.</h4>
              How many of us are guilty of this? We all love our cosy nests but the reality is that
              with time, it collects a lot of grimy stuff such as dead skin cells, body oils, pollen,
              dust and even dust mites. Hence, the mistake of not changing the pillow covers, bed sheets,
              and towels at least once a week is an indirect invitation to allergies, acne and in some cases,
              it can also trigger eczema and contact dermatitis. So be sure that you don’t feel lazy about washing
              your bedding often and then properly sun dry them.

              <h4>3. Taking the phone to the toilet.</h4>
              Loo was once considered “me time” but that too has been taken over by our cell phones.
              Don’t make this mistake. Toilets aren’t the most hygienic places anyway. Carrying a phone along
              exposes it to many unwanted germs like salmonella and E coli that can make you sick. In fact,
              hygiene experts believe that when you clean yourself and then hold the phone again,
              even washing your hands becomes worthless. This is because the bacteria had by then stuck to your
              mobile, which you hold again after washing your hands. Perhaps it is wiser to keep something to
              read in the toilet always. Anyhow, there are some objects which have been found to host
              more bacteria than a toilet seat. Phones and computer keyboards are on top of the list. In
              the modern era, they are more like extended parts of our body and deserve to get cleaned often.
              Else, the germs from such devices get transferred onto us during the day and may cause allergies and
              even food poisoning. Be careful.
              </p>

              <h4>4. Is never cleaning the comb.</h4>

              When was the last time you cleaned that comb? With time, germs, oil, dust, and other free
              radicals tend to build up and can thrive on your brushes and combs. Using these uncleaned
              combs and brushes on hair, you subject them to a host of hair and scalp problems like dandruff,
              infections, and hair fall, which is why not cleaning the hairbrushes is a hygiene
              mistake we should strive to avoid. At least once a month, soak the combs and brushes in soapy water
              for 30 minutes before scrubbing off the dirt and build-up with an old toothbrush. Rinse and dry and
              they are ready to style your hair once again.
              </p>

              <h4>5. Using body soap daily.</h4>
              Now, this might have taken you aback but believe
              it or not, there is no need to rigorously rub soap all through your body. Definitely, not daily.
              And if you have dry skin, you are rather striping the body of essential oils and asking for cracked
              and wrinkly skin. Precisely, there are only two places which regularly need the soapy action.
              First is the armpit area and the other is the groin area. Obviously, as they are skin folded,
              they tend to get sweaty and accumulate a lot of dirt. These two if not cleaned properly become an
              ideal playground for harmful microorganisms. So make certain that you do not miss properly
              cleaning them daily. And for the whole body two to three times a week is more than enough depending
              on your skin and the environment you are exposed to. The same holds true for shampooing the hair.
              </p>

              <p>
              <h4>6. Is Wearing damp clothes Who likes to wear damp clothes anyway?</h4>
              Although, often after working out in the evening we neglect to change our sweaty clothes for hours.
              This calls for germ buildup and if you happen to have sensitive skin,
              you can face the consequences in the form of skin rashes, allergies and fungal infections.
              So the next time after you are done working out, if bathing isn’t an option, simply changing the
              clothes will do. Another hygiene mistake is to dry the clothes indoors or worst so, in a humid
              atmosphere of a bathroom. This is also why we tend to catch infections easily in the rainy
              season. Embrace sunlight as it not only dries them appropriately but is also a natural disinfectant.
              </p>
