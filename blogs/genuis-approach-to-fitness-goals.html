              <p>
                In this blog, we'll share with you five smart practises for good health that
                are simple to follow yet have a big impact on health.
              </p>

              <p>
                A genius is someone who focuses low-hanging fruit and accomplishes his fitness goals
                without sacrificing taste or health while also saving money.
              </p>

              <hr />

              <h4>1. A genius will make use of the sunlight.</h4>
              <p>
                The power of sunlight has now been proven beyond all doubt. Even if he is aware of the fantastic
                benefits of the sun,
                the average person will fail to take advantage of nature's free gift.
              </p>

              <p>
                A genius, on the other hand, will not only use it, but will also save time and effort.
                He will frequently keep pulses and grains outside in the sunlight, especially during the rainy season,
                to keep them free from any germs. In the winter, when washing is impractical,
                he will regularly place his blanket in the sunlight to keep it fresh and warm.
                He will even benefit from sun-charged water. An average person will crave low vitamin D in his diet
                and may rely on synthetic tablets. A genius, on the other hand, will make time to sunbathe and will
                expose
                his weakest body parts to the sun because he knows that the sun is the ultimate healer.
              </p>

              <p>
                An ordinary person will spray chemical deodorizers and disinfectants in his home,
                whereas a genius will leave the window shades open and allow nature's own sanitizer to enter
                because he understands the importance of sunlight in reducing indoor pollution.
              </p>

              <p>
                A genius will make the best use of mother nature's divine gift because he knows it naturally improves
                mood,
                strengthens the immune system, lowers blood pressure, and improves sleep quality.
              </p>

              <hr />
              <h4>2.A genius will eat seasonally and locally.</h4>
              <p>
                Food, no matter how nutritious it appears on paper, isn't worth it if it isn't absorbed by the body.
              </p>

              <p>
                An ordinary person will fail to recognise this; he will believe that more expensive is always better
                and
                will opt for off-season and even foreign fruits and vegetables at double the price from supermarkets.
              </p>

              <p>
                A genius will go to a local vegetable and fruit vendor and buy the cheapest produce because he knows
                that
                the cheapest fruits and vegetables are seasonal. He understands that locally grown items should be more
                fresh
                and cost effective, and he also understands that food that is local and in season is not only tastier
                and juicier,
                but it is also better absorbed and assimilated in the body.
              </p>

              <p>
                While the genius only pays for fruits and vegetables, the ignorant person also pays for cold storage and
                transportation.
              </p>

              <p>
                Tragically, even after spending so much money on exotic foods, an ignorant man will suffer from
                nutritional deficiencies.
              </p>

              <p>
                A genius will not only save money, but his skin will be healthier, his hair will be shinier, and his
                body will be more active.
              </p>

              <hr />
              <h4>3. A genius will make home food interesting.</h4>
              <p>
                Only a ordinary person will maintain their home cooking monotonous; as a result, he will despise it and
                spend excessive amounts
                of money on pricey restaurants and delivered food, which will harm his health.
              </p>

              <p>
                On the other hand, a genius will make an effort to make his home cooking as exciting as possible.
                Unlike an ordinary individual, he will place a priority on variety first.
                He will make sure to eat a variety of vibrant fruits and veggies. Because he appreciates the
                significance of sweet flavour,
                he will also partake in a variety of sweets made with natural sweeteners. He can create a meal plan and
                post it in the kitchen
                so that he is well-prepared. By planning ahead and consuming a variety of meals, he will not only break
                the monotony of eating
                the same bland foods, but his diet will also naturally include a range of micronutrients.
              </p>

              <hr />
              <h4>4. A genius will not count calories.</h4>

              <p>
                An ordinary person will attempt to simplify their fitness journey into calorie counting.
                He will sign up with dieticians and just take down how many calories he should consume, how much water
                he should drink, and so on.
                He will then eat in accordance with what the calculator advises him to do.
              </p>

              <p>A genius, however, will continue to be cognizant of the reality that not all calories are created
                equal.
                He won't get as much sustenance from 200 calories from a soft drink as he will from 200 calories of
                fresh milk.
                He is aware that restricting healthy calories deprives the body of vital vitamins and minerals as well
                as energy.
                He won't bother with calorie counting and will instead eat deliberately, savouring every bite.
                He will tune into his very own dietitian, the stomach, rather than paying the expensive fees to the
                dieticians.
                He will be able to tell if he is truly hungry or merely thirsty, and guess who loses more weight? Of
                course, a genius.
                If he feels full on one day, he might skip supper; on another, if he is very hungry, he might eat
                accordingly.
              </p>

              <p>
                Even the Harvard Medical School admits that the concept of calories in and calories out is incorrect
                when it comes to weight loss.
                In order to thrive like a genius, listen to your body.
              </p>

              <hr />
              <h4>5. A genius will eat smartly.</h4>
              <p>
                Even eating the healthiest foods in excess can lead to health issues.
              </p>

              <p>
                First, a ordinary person will eat more than they need to in order to prevent food waste.
                In the event that he cannot complete it, he will keep the food refrigerated and reheat it before eating.
              </p>

              <p>
                A genius understands that eating food in the appropriate amounts and when it is fresh is best for the
                body.
                A genius will first attempt to make only a sufficient amount of food; but, if there is extra food
                prepared,
                he will undoubtedly avoid overeating and overloading his body. He will not even reheat and eat the same
                food since
                he is aware that food has vital prana that reduces over time.
              </p>

              <p>
                Instead of throwing away food, he will share it with the animals and other creatures around him since
                he thinks that wasting food is a human-centric attitude. Instead of making it unpleasant for his body,
                he is considerate enough to make it enjoyable for the other living forms around him. Not to mention
                the mental delight he will get as a result of this responsible act of compassion.
              </p>
              <br />
