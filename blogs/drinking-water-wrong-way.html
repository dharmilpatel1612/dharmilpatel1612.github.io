              <p>
                Since our bodies are two thirds water, it is crucial to drink enough water for the organs to work
                properly.
                However, when consumed incorrectly, the same water causes shocking health problems such as migraine,
                joint pain, poor digestion, skin problems, hair loss, lethargy, heart problems, and kidney problems.
                <br />

                The sad part is that 99% of people drink water incorrectly. As a result,
                rather than benefiting from this miraculous drink, they are unintentionally harming their bodies.
                <br />

                Water is the most important nutrient for our bodies, without it we cannot use the nutrients found in
                carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Because water is so important and beneficial,
                it does not mean that we can drink it whenever we want.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will discuss some causes of improper water consumption in this blog post, along with solutions.
              </p>

              <h4>1. Consuming water both before and after meals.</h4>
              <p>
                After meals, gulping a glass of water may be the most satisfying thing for you.
                However this is the worst thing you can do to your body. When we eat a meal,
                our body temperature rises to aid digestion, drinking water immediately after meals dilutes the gastric
                juices,
                reducing the body's ability to digest food. As a result, the food is not properly digested and rots
                within the system,
                and when food rots within the system, not only does your body fail to absorb the nutrients from it,
                but it also causes digestive problems such as floating gas acidity, etc.


                This is the reason why you hear people complain that they consume largely healthy foods but are still
                unable to achieve the expected outcomes,
                such as their inability to lose weight while drinking enough water.

                The reason for this is that you are drinking water immediately before or after meals.
                One simple trick you can use is to rinse your mouth with water instead of drinking it it really helps.
              </p>

              <h4>2. Gulping down the water.</h4>
              <p>
                In today's fast-paced world, most people drink water mindlessly. It may seem difficult to believe,
                but the way water enters your body can make a significant difference. If you drink water too quickly,
                your body will reject it and flush the majority of it out, which is the exact opposite of what you want
                to happen.


                Furthermore, our stomach is acidic by nature, whereas saliva in our mouth is alkaline by nature,
                and its job is to stabilise the acid in our stomach.

                When we gulp a large amount of water at once, very little saliva is mixed with the water,
                so the atmosphere inside the stomach remains acidic, causing acidity, indigestion, bloating,
                gas, and even weight gain because the stomach fails to absorb nutrients from food and remove unwanted
                material from the body.
                To begin, it is best to slowly sip the water. Avoid bottles with wide mouths, or even better, use a
                glass or sipper.
              </p>

              <h4>3. Consuming cold water.</h4>
              <p>
                Do you run to the refrigerator after you get home from work to quench your thirst?
                If so, you should stop because drinking chilled water not only causes a sore throat but also has serious
                consequences.

                First of all, drinking cold water substantially hinders digestion by constricting blood vessels.
                Cold water also tends to harden meal fats, making it difficult for your body to break down excess fat.

                Joint pains are a significant adverse impact of drinking cold water. In addition, numerous research have
                shown that drinking cooled water lowers heart rate nowadays. Water should preferably be consumed at room
                temperature.


                Although lukewarm water is beneficial, if you must drink cold water, begin by using earthen pots,
                which not only provide natural water cooling but also balance the ph of the water, removing impurities.
              </p>

              <h4>4. Drinking excessively</h4>

              <p>
                People who force themselves to drink water throughout the day even when they are not thirsty
                because they were told that more water equals more benefits

                Of course, proper hydration is essential, but excess of anything is harmful, and this is true for water.

                Also, drinking too much water dilutes the salts and other electrolytes in our bodies,
                and one of sodium's jobs is to balance the fluid in and around your cells.
                Drinking too much water causes an imbalance, and the liquid moves from your blood to inside your cells,
                causing them to swell, which is especially bad news for brain cells.
                Yellowish urine and past lips are some of the signs that your body is dehydrated.
              </p>

              <h4>How much water to drink?</h4>
              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                The amount of water that a person needs each day varies on a variety of factors,
                including their body type, weight, level of physical activity, and climate.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                It would be unfair to give one fixed quantity because your body gets water from various foods such as
                fruits and vegetables.
                It is best to see how your body responds and drink accordingly.
                In general, 2.5 to 3 litres per day is sufficient.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Water can be consumed in any utensil, but the benefits are multiplied if you drink it from a copper
                vessel.
                It is recommended to store water in a copper vessel the night before, keep it near you,
                preferably on a wooden surface, and drink this water first thing in the morning.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Water is life. It is a cure-all for many health issues, but we need to drink it the right way.
                Make sure you drink from the copper vessel itself and not transfer it into any other metal container.
                Drink this copper charged water for just three months, and you will be amazed at what it does to your
                body.
