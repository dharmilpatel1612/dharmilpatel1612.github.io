              <p>
                Today's ears are one of the most abused sense organs, and we frequently take them for granted.
                As a result, ear problems are on the rise. Furthermore, if you frequently suffer from neck and jaw
                stiffness,
                headaches, nervous disorders, weak bones, or difficulty balancing your body, you should begin taking
                care of your ears.
              </p>

              <p>
                This blog will go over the worst and best daily habits, as well as some simple but highly effective
                practises
                that will keep your ears and related organs healthy for a long time.
              </p>

              <p>
                As opposed to popular belief, ears are intricately linked to the brain, neck, sinuses, mouth, and bones,
                which is why maintaining good ear health is crucial.
              </p>

              <p>
                There are several indications that signal hearing loss, such as ringing, buzzing, or roaring in the ears
                after exposure to loud noises.
                stiffness in the neck and jaws, poor oral health, difficulty speaking, inability to balance the body,
                dizziness when standing on one leg,
                headache due to noise Despite the fact that there is no deficiency, the bones are weak. nervous system
                disorders
                Irritation to loud noises is your body's way of telling you to take care of your ears.
              </p>

              <p>
                According to WHO, one in every four people will have hearing problems by 2050, and the main cause is
                exposure to loud noises,
                which could be from listening to loud music or working in a noisy environment.
              </p>

              <h4>How does noise cause hearing loss ?</h4>
              <p>
                The ear is composed of three components that work together to process sounds. the middle ear, the outer
                ear, and the inner ear
              </p>
              <p>
                The inner ear contains tiny hair cells that help send sound messages to the brain.
                Loud noise can damage these hair cells over time, and as more and more hair cells are damaged, hearing
                capability deteriorates.
              </p>

              <p>
                Other than loud noise increased earphone use and lengthy phone calls
                cotton swabs are frequently used, prodding ears with the fingers.
                Alcohol, stress, and other vices all contribute to the year's woes.
              </p>

              <p>
                Certainly, there are steps we can take to safeguard
              </p>

              <p>
                When receiving a call in private, utilise the loudspeaker setting. For extended phone calls,
                wear earplugs and keep the level at no higher than 60% of the maximum.
                In reality, we should get used to hearing at low volumes.
              </p>

              <p>
                If your line of work requires you to operate in a noisy workplace, you should always carry earplugs with
                you.
                They are conveniently sold at any pharmacy and are a godsend for the ears.
                Roll it out, plug it in, and work quietly.
              </p>

              <p>
                Since the ears are a self-cleaning organ, there is no need to worry about periodically cleaning the
                earwax;
                in fact, earwax is crucial for the ears' lubrication and protection from a variety of issues.
              </p>

              <p>
                Therefore, daily use of cotton swabs is strictly prohibited; instead, use one of the other safe methods
                to remove the extra wax.
              </p>

              <p>
                According to ayurveda, the ears are a main vata organ that is connected to the neurological system and
                bone tissue layer.
                Ear oiling is a simple ayurvedic treatment for ear care that may be performed in just a few seconds and
                is effective in treating the majority of ear ailments.

                The ayurveda scriptures highly promote this technique, to the point that if someone doesn't have time
                for a full body massage,
                they should at least oil their head, the inside of their ears, and their feet.
              </p>

              <p>
                Certainly, there are several levels depending on each person's demands.
              </p>

              <p>
                Level 1: If you currently have no ear issues and would like to keep them that way for a long time,
                you should just follow these simple instructions every morning after taking a bath: first,
                gently clean and dry your ear with a cotton cloth; next, using your index finger,
                gently apply a little pure cold-pressed oil in each of your ears. This could be mustard or sesame oil;
                this will not only keep the issues at bay but also cause ear wax to come off more easily.
              </p>

              <p>
                Level 2: Garlic oil should be used in karna prati sarnam if you regularly swim, frequently get ear
                infections or ear pain,
                or frequently expose your ears to loud noises. Since most ear infections are viral and cannot be treated
                with antibiotics,
                garlic oil, which has antibacterial and antiviral properties, is an effective remedy.
              </p>
