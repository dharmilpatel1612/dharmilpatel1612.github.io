              <p>
                We will discuss some of the intelligent and practical ways of storing
                different food items in the kitchen so that they can stay naturally fresh and flavourful
                for longer. If you have a small fridge or you find organising your fridge problematic,this blog shall be
                helpful.

              <h3>Food items which need not be kept in the fridge.</h3>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Surprisingly, there are some food items which need not be kept
                in the fridge. This one can be a gamechanger not only for someone who has a small fridge
                but also if you wish to get the flavour back into your food.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                First are the spices. How often do we
                open a packet of the spice and toss it in the refrigerator? The number one enemy of spices
                is humidity which not only changes their texture but also robs their flavour. Spices are not meant
                to be kept in the fridge. They will serve you the best if kept in the cupboard in an airtight
                container where the environment is dark and dry. Airtight is important if you want them to stay
                fresh for at least 6 months.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Pickles and sauces, since they have natural preservatives in them
                remain the most flavourful when kept out of the fridge.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Then many people tend to keep nuts and
                seeds in the fridge. It’s unnecessary. Air is the number one enemy of any dry fruit's shelf life.
                The solution is to keep them in airtight containers where they will easily serve
                you for a year. If you tend to store the nuts in non-airtight containers in the fridge or elsewhere
                you are asking for their overall texture and flavour to be ruined.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Oils like that of mustard,
                sesame, coconut, peanut and even ghee need not be kept in the fridge. They are better kept in a dark
                and dry place. Oils being reactive stay best when kept in glass bottles or containers rather than in
                plastic or metal containers. In fact, ayurvedic scriptures suggest that ghee if properly stored
                in airtight glass, ceramic or mud containers gets more medicinal with time.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Then potatoes,onions and garlic which are on top of the grocery list of most people prefer room
                temperature. Cold
                temperature breaks down the starches in potatoes, making them unpleasantly sweet. The humidity of
                the refrigerator makes onions mouldy and mushy. Garlic can’t stand cold temperatures either. To
                retain their powerful flavour, keep them in a well-ventilated place outside the fridge.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Citrus fruits like lemons and oranges remain fresh and juicy for longer if kept outside the fridge.
                In fact, keeping the lemons wrapped in newspaper or any paper bag helps preserve them for longer.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Melons like watermelon and muskmelon are also pretty sturdy and can easily remain fresh
                for a long time without refrigeration. Of course,
                they taste best when a bit cool. So, you can keep them in the fridge 1 hour before eating
                or opt for the old ways where there used to be soaked in water before eating.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Even mangoes are recommended to be soaked in water before hopping on.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Keeping bread in the fridge is also not the best idea because, at lower temperatures,
                water evaporates significantly faster and so the bread will become dry and brittle.
                Bread is best kept in a firmly closed box or simply tie it tightly with a rubber band.
              </p>       

              <hr />
              <h3>Food items which are better kept in the fridge.</h3>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Most of us keep milk and milk products at the side door of the fridge but this isn’t a great
                place to store them. As the door gets frequently opened, it is prone to temperature fluctuations
                which are not ideal for the shelf life of milk and milk products like butter, curd and paneer.
                They stay better if kept at the back side of the fridge shelf which is relatively cooler.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                The leafy greens will also serve you for longer if kept in the fridge. However, they rot faster
                in humid conditions of the fridge. So, to increase their shelf life roughly cut their stems off and
                store them either in paper bags or keep them in an airtight container with tissue paper. Cutting the
                stems slows their ageing and tissue paper helps them stay dry.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Similarly, to keep chillies fresh for longer, remove their buds, wrap them in tissue paper
                and store them in an airtight container.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Talking tomatoes, if they are not fully ripened which means they are still yellowish, are better
                kept outside the fridge. However, if they are completely red and juicy, to prolong their shelf
                life refrigeration is better.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Other vegetables like the gourd family, capsicum,
                cauliflower, carrots, cabbage and beetroot will remain fresher for longer when refrigerated.
              </p>

              <hr/>
              <h3>Food items which need special attention.</h3>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Bananas are one of them. They naturally
                emit a high amount of ethylene gas which is why if any other fruit or vegetable is kept alongside it,
                it ripens faster. So, as a thumb rule, keep bananas separate. Bananas ripen the fastest
                if not kept open. Bananas will serve you for longer if hanged. Investing in a banana hanger
                is a wise decision.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Apples are another example of high ethylene emitting food. Keep them separate outside the fridge.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                One should be careful with mushrooms. If washed and placed on the counter,
                they will rot faster. It’s best that they stay in their plastic packaging in the fridge,
                and be washed with hot water only before cooking.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                On the flipside, carrots will remain crispier for longer if stored in water.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                There are certain food items that love darkness.
                Apart from the already discussed foods like oils, potatoes, onions and garlic, tea, coffee and honey
                have an aversion for light. All these begin to lose their flavour and medicinal properties when
                exposed to light. Tea, coffee and honey also tend to absorb flavours from the environment.
                So, they are best kept in airtight containers in the kitchen cupboards.
              </p>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Honey is quite reactive, so it will stay the best if stored in a glass jar.
              </p>
