              <p>
                Immune system protects our body from infections.
                Week immune system is like a invitation to health problems.
              </p>

              <p>
                How can your immune system be strengthened? Overall, your immune system is incredibly effective in
                protecting you from pathogenic microbes. But occasionally it fails, allowing a virus to infect you and
                make you ill. Can you influence this process to strengthen your immune system? What if your diet was
                improved? take certain herbal or vitamin supplements? make additional lifestyle adjustments in an effort
                to generate a nearly flawless immunological response?
              </p>

              <hr />
              <h4>1. Maintain a healthy diet</h4>
              <p>
                A nutritious diet is essential for a healthy immune system, as it is with most other aspects of your
                body. To do this, make sure you consume an abundance of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, lean
                meats, and healthy fats.
              </p>
              <p>
                Exercise is crucial for maintaining good health and a strong immune system, in addition to helping you
                grow muscles and reduce stress.
              </p>
              <p>
                These micronutrients include:
              </p>
              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>Vitamin B6, found in chicken, salmon, tuna, bananas, green vegetables
                and potatoes (with the skin)</p>
              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>Vitamin C, found in citrus fruit, including oranges and strawberries,
                as well as tomatoes, broccoli and spinach</p>
              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>Vitamin E, found in almonds, sunflower and safflower oil, sunflower
                seeds, peanut butter and spinach</p>
              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>Zinc, found in oysters, red meat, poultry, beans, dairy products</p>
              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>Magnesium, found in whole wheat products, nuts, seeds</p>
              <p>
                Since experts believe that your body absorbs vitamins more efficiently from dietary sources, rather than
                supplements,
                the best way to support your immune system is to eat a well-balanced diet.
              </p>

              <hr />
              <h4>2. Exercise regularly</h4>
              <p>
                Physical activity isn't just for building muscles and helping yourself de-stress — it's also an
                important
                part of being healthy and supporting a healthy immune system.
              </p>
              <p>
                Exercise of a moderate intensity releases immune cells from the bone into the bloodstream.
                Additionally, it aids in the transfer of immune cells already in circulation to tissues.
                It improves immunological surveillance in this way.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can think of immune surveillance as a monitoring process of your immune system, with exercise
                helping immune
                cells be more efficient at detecting and reacting to infection.
              </p>
              <p>
                This means it's important to focus on staying active and getting regular exercise.
              </p>

              <hr />
              <h4>3. Drink plenty of water</h4>
              <p>
                Water plays many important roles in your body, including supporting your immune system.
              </p>
              <p>
                Water is important because our blood and lymph, which have immune cells in them, need water in order
                to flow to circulate throughout our bodies.
              </p>
              <p>
                You regularly lose water through your breath, urine, and bowel movements, even if you're not working out
                or perspiring. Make sure you're replacing the water you lose with water you can utilise to assist your
                immune system.
              </p>

              <hr />
              <h4>4. Get plenty of sleep</h4>
              <p>
                Sleep certainly doesn't feel like an active process, but there are plenty of important things
                happening in your body when you're not awake.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sleep is important for immune function and the immune system’s homeostasis.
              </p>
              <p>
                To give your immune system the best chance to fight off infection and illness, it's important to know
                how much sleep you should be getting every night, as well as the steps to take if your sleep is
                suffering.
              </p>

              <hr />
              <h4>5. Reduce your stress</h4>
              <p>
                Whether it comes on quick or builds over time, it's important to understand how chronic stress affects
                your health.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stress can potentially have a secondary impact on how well your immune system functions if it leads to
                sleep disturbances,
                a tendency to eat less healthy food, reduced water intake, less frequent exercise and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everybody experiences stress differently, and so do our coping mechanisms. Knowing how to recognise
                stress is crucial given the impact it can have on your health. Additionally, you should become familiar
                with the practises that lower your stress levels, whether they are deep breathing, meditation, prayer,
                or exercise.
              </p>
