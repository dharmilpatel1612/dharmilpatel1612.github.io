              <p>
                Bad breath, also known as halitosis, is embarrassing and can undermine your self-esteem.
                Bad breath can be caused by a variety of factors, including odorous foods, smoking,
                dry mouth, medical conditions, gum disease, and sinus problems.
              </p>

              <p>
                However, bacteria that accumulate on the back of your tongue or between your teeth are the primary cause
                of bad breath.
                Controlling bad breath requires maintaining good oral health. This includes brushing, flossing, and
                tongue scraping on a regular basis.
                Drinking plenty of water throughout the day is also important for keeping your breath fresh.
                Additionally, after eating, swish water around your mouth for a few seconds.
                This will clean your mouth and loosen food particles stuck between your teeth.
              </p>

              <h4>Remedies</h4>

              <h5>1. Fennel</h5>
              <p>
                Fennel is an excellent mouth freshener that aids in the control of bad breath.
                It also has antimicrobial properties that help to fight bacteria in the mouth.
                Chew a tablespoon of fennel slowly to freshen your breath and stimulate saliva production.
                Drink fennel tea several times per day. Steep one or two teaspoons of fennel seeds in a
                cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes to make this tea.
              </p>

              <h5>2. Cinnamon</h5>
              <p>
                Cinnamon contains cinnamic aldehyde, an essential oil that not only masks bad breath but also reduces
                bacteria in your mouth.
                Use this remedy twice daily to treat bad breath.
                Boil 1 teaspoon cinnamon powder in a cup of water with bay leaves and cardamom.
                To refresh your breath, strain the solution and use it as a mouth rinse.
              </p>

              <h5>3. Cloves</h5>
              <p>
                Cloves help to freshen your breath and have antibacterial properties that can help you get rid of bad
                breath.
                The simplest method is to put a few cloves in your mouth and chew them thoroughly.
                This will get rid of bad breath in a matter of minutes.
                Make some clove tea. Bring a cup of water to a boil, then add one teaspoon of ground cloves and let it
                simmer for 5 to 10 minutes.
                Twice a day, drink the tea or use it as a mouthwash.
              </p>

              <h5>4. Parsley</h5>
              <p>
                Parsley contains chlorophyll, which can help to eliminate bad breath.
                To refresh your breath, chew on a fresh parsley sprig. You can also soak this herb in vinegar before
                chewing it thoroughly.
                Another option is to juice parsley leaves and sip the juice whenever you need to freshen your breath.
                It will also help with digestion.
              </p>

              <h5>5. Apple cider vinegar</h5>
              <p>
                Apple cider vinegar is an excellent remedy for bad breath due to its ph-balancing properties.
                Depending on your preferences, you can try any of these remedies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Drink one tablespoon of raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar in a glass of water before each meal.
                The vinegar will aid digestion and cure bad breath.
                Gargle with a cup of apple cider vinegar mixed with water.
              </p>

              <h5>6. Baking soda</h5>
              <p>
                Baking soda, also known as bicarbonate of soda, is another excellent remedy for eliminating and
                preventing bad breath.
                It helps to balance the acid levels that contribute to bad breath. Furthermore, it combats oral bacteria
                that cause bad breath.
                Use a half teaspoon of baking soda in a glass of warm water as a mouth rinse once a day until you are
                satisfied with the results.
                Brushing your teeth with baking soda will also help to reduce acidity in your mouth and prevent bacteria
                from accumulating on your tongue.
              </p>

              <h5>7. Tea tree oil</h5>
              <p>
                Tea tree oil has antiseptic properties that act as a powerful mouth disinfectant.
                Tea tree oil can be beneficial in a variety of ways.
                Brush your teeth with a tea tree oil toothpaste.
                Another option is to use a few drops of tea tree oil along with your regular toothpaste on your
                toothbrush.
                You can also make a mouthwash by combining a few drops of tea tree oil, peppermint oil, and lemon oil in
                a glass of water.
              </p>

              <h5>8. Tea</h5>
              <p>
                Teas, both regular and herbal, can also help with bad breath. The antioxidant polyphenols found in both
                green and black tea
                can inhibit the growth of bacteria that cause bad breath.
                To make this tea, steep 1 teaspoon dried sage in 1 cup hot water for 5 minutes. To keep your breath
                fresh,
                strain and drink this tea several times a day.
                If your bad breath persists after you've tried these natural remedies, see a doctor or dentist to see if
                there's a more serious underlying issue.
              </p>

              <h4>Tips to prevent bad breath</h4>

              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Drink a lot of water and gargle with cool water. In particular, it helps to eliminate "morning breath."
                Brush your teeth after each meal, and floss at least twice daily.
              </p>
              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Every two to three months, change your your toothbrush.
              </p>
              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Arrange regular dental check-ups and cleansing.
              </p>
              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Scrape your tongue each morning with a tongue scraper or spoon to decrease the bacteria,
                fungi, and dead cells that can cause odour. Hold the tip of the tongue with gauze to pull it forward in
                order to clean the back of the tongue.
              </p>
              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Take a few cloves, fennel, or anise seeds in your mouth. The halitosis-causing bacteria are fought off
                by their antiseptic properties.
              </p>
              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Chew on some lemon or orange rind for a flavorful mouth-freshening boost. (First, carefully wash the
                rind.)
                Citric acid will increase saliva production and combat foul breath.
              </p>
              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Take a fresh parsley, basil, mint, or cilantro sprig and chew it. These green plants' chlorophyll
                neutralises odours.
              </p>
              <p><span class="mx-1">&bullet;</span>
                Try using alcohol-free mouthwash for 30 seconds (unlike many off-the-shelf products).
                To combat mouth odour, combine a teaspoon of baking soda with a cup of water, a few drops of peppermint
                essential oil,
                which has antibacterial properties. Avoid swallowing it! (Produces numerous rinses.)
              </p>
